            <h2 class="content-subheader">Handling hardware</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Manjaro not only supports the use of multiple kernels (selectable from the advanced options at the boot screen), but allows easy access to the very latest bleeding edge kernels as well. This is undertaken through use of the Kernel module in Manjaro's graphical Settings Manager, or via the command line with the MHWD-kernel (Manjaro Hardware Detection) command.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">These Manjaro tools will automatically update a newly installed kernel including any modules currently in use with your existing kernel. For example, if you were to update from kernel 3.16 to 3.18, mhwd-kernel would automatically include the 3.18 builds of any and all modules presently used in 3.16. How about that!</p>
            <p class="paragraph">You can configure your hardware through the Hardware Detection module in the Settings Manager or alternatively with the MHWD cli-application. With these tools you can install for example graphical drivers, free and propritary.</p>
            <h2 class="content-subheader">Getting help</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Although Manjaro is designed to work as much "out of the box" as possible, we don't claim it's perfect. There can be times when things go wrong, you might have questions and a desire to learn more or just want to personalise it to suit your tastes. This page provides details of some available resources to help you!</p>
            <h3 class="subparagraph">Search the web</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Perhaps the first place to look for generic Linux help is by using your favourite search engine. Just include words like 'Linux', 'Manjaro' or 'Arch' in your search query.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As Manjaro is based on Arch Linux, guides and tips designed for Arch usually apply to Manjaro too.</p>
            <h3 class="subparagraph">Look in the forums</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">For specific help with Manjaro we have a dedicated online forum where you can search for topics, or create one yourself! This is probably the next best place to go for collaboration, discussion and assistance. Ask for help, post your thoughts, or outline some suggestions. Don't be shy!</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The Manjaro forum is divided into sub-forums for different topics and environments, please post your query in the appropriate place!</p>
            <h3 class="subparagraph">Join us on IRC (Internet Relay Chat)</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Another option is to join us on IRC by joining our #manjaro channel on the chat.freenode.net servers.
            <h3 class="subparagraph">Sign up to a mailing list</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Another way to get help is to email questions to a Manjaro mailing list (you can also search the history for past discussions). Simply sign up to the list you prefer and follow the instructions. There is a list dedicated to several topics, just take a look!</p>
