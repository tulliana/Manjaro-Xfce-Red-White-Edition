Manjaro JWM Edition is a respin of Manjaro Linux maintained by the community. It is mainly targetted at people who are new to WMs, or experienced people who want to have a fully functional system after the installation. This project is still in heavy development, so things might change a lot with each release. Even though the current release is labeled as dev, it should be stable enough to work on an actual system. If you've tested this release, please share your feedback so we can keep improving this respin of the Manjaro. You can do this in the following Manjaro Forum - https://forum.manjaro.org. Current version 15.dev - Code 41215 (in https://sourceforge.net/projects/manjaropek/). kind regards, Manjaro JWM Edition...
