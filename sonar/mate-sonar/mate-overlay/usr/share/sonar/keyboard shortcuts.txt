Please note that, while these shortcuts are set up in the mate edition, the shortcuts for toggling the magnifier, and the on screen keyboard do not work. This is because mate does not come with it's own magnifier, and even though an onscreen keyboard is included, the keyboard shortcuts are not hooked up to that application. This is being worked on.
